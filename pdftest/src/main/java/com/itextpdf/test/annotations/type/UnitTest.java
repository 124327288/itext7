/**
 * Unit Tests are used to check individual units of source code. A unit test
 * will only use the Testing Framework and the individual unit that is being
 * tested, but does not depend on any other functionality of the Software Under
 * Test.
 * <p>
 * A simple rule to determine if you have written a unit test: if your test
 * produces a PDF file and uses the CompareTool to verify it with a sample file,
 * then it is <strong>not</strong> a unit test.
 * <p>
 * Typically a unit test will run very fast.
